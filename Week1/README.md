# **Graph Neural Networks for Drug Discovery**

This project focuses on using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for molecular analysis in drug discovery. By representing molecules as graphs, GNNs can capture complex relationships within chemical compounds, enabling accurate predictions of properties and interactions essential for drug development.

## **What You’ll Learn**
- Understand how GNNS, GCNs work and their applications in drug discovery and learn to process molecular data as graphs for property prediction.
- Gain hands-on experience with tools like PyTorch Geometric, RDKit, and ChEMBL.
- Graphical Neural Networks will be really great from Resume point of view as well since it is used heavily in real world projects.
