#Drug Discovery Using Graph Neural Networks

Project Overview
This project aims to leverage Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug discovery, focusing on molecular analysis to identify potential drug candidates efficiently and accurately. By representing molecular structures as graphs, GNNs can capture complex relationships within chemical compounds, leading to data-driven predictions of properties and interactions crucial in drug development.

As a mentee, you’ll learn the fundamentals of Graph Neural Networks, their application in computational drug discovery, and the process of training these models to make predictions based on molecular data.

Learning Resources
Before diving into the implementation, here’s a list of essential resources to help you build a strong foundation:

Week 1:- Get familier with Python libraries:- Numpy, Matplotlib, Pytorch

Some articles:-
https://purnasaigudikandula.medium.com/a-beginner-intro-to-neural-networks-543267bda3c8

Read the introductory chapter from “Introduction To Machine Learning - Gurney et. al.” and optionally the theory (Highly recommended)
Complete the given tutorials. Leave the advanced neural Networks part of it.

- Note: We know that the tutorials we provided mostly cover the implementation of the neural network, we just want you to play with it yourself and understand each part of the code. You can also refer to the book mentioned above for a better understanding of the theory.


Assignment-1: Implementing K-means clustering algorithm using Numpy fundamentals. 
Assignment-2: Implementing Feed Forward Neural Network on cat and dog dataset on kaggle and improving the model accuracy using various preprocessing techniques and hyperparameter finetuning to improve the model accuracy.
Assignment-3 (Optional): Implement the Feed Forward Neural Network using numpy and compare the results with the Pytorch implementation.


Week 2:- Understanding Some Advanced Neural networks, their working and intuition and Graph Neural Networks Basics
