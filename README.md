# **Graph Neural Networks for Drug Discovery**

This project focuses on using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for molecular analysis in drug discovery. By representing molecules as graphs, GNNs can capture complex relationships within chemical compounds, enabling accurate predictions of properties and interactions essential for drug development.

## **What You’ll Learn**
- Understand how GNNS, GCNs work and their applications in drug discovery and learn to process molecular data as graphs for property prediction.
- Gain hands-on experience with tools like PyTorch Geometric, RDKit, and ChEMBL.
- Graphical Neural Networks will be really great from Resume point of view as well since it is used heavily in real world projects.

**Submission of Assigments**: Make your github repository, we will also float the official GitHub repo for WiDs in a few days. You can clone our repo and add your work to it. We will float Google forms asking the repo links, please feel free to reach out in case you are new to GitHub.


> **This Project will demand mentees to grasp heavy content with various non trivial concepts so remaining consistent on the projects with regularly and sincerely attempting and completing assignments will be expected and it will make the learnings smooth for this project. If you ever feel that the project is being slow or fast, you can definitely reach out to us in order to solve the issue. If you do not understand any concept or remain stuck at it, you can always google them or use chat gpt to understand them (most of the times this will work) and you can always definitely reach out to us to clear any doubts.**
